# NueralNetworkOptimizer (Yes it is spelled "Nu")
implemented a genetic algorithm in matlab that optimizes a given neural network.Users can set the number of hidden layer and hidden layer units,number of chromosome in population and much more.
In the original code,the iris dataset has been used.In order to run the algorithm with other datasets,the "runAnnwithGA" has to be modified as following:
1.Set the input and output variables according to the labels in the dataset
2.set the input layer units and output layer units according to the number of input an output classes in the dataset

Users can modify the parameters to observe how the neural network is optimised for a given dataset which includes optimizing the number of hidden layer units and number of hiddern layers for a given dataset
